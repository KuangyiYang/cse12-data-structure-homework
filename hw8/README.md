## Project 8 Hash Table and Spell Checker
### Summary
You will create a simple spell checker. First you will write a hash table that will be used to store the words. Then your program will read a set of words from a file (dictionary) that is given as the first argument, insert the words into a hash table.
Then the spelling checker will read a list of words from another file that is given as a second argument. Each word will be looked up in the dictionary. If it is incorrect, it will be written to the standard output together with a list of suggested corrections.

- HashTable.java (Contains the main function)
