## DarkRoom
### Summary
In this assignment you will implement data structures that provide an implementation for three abstract data types: A queue using a circular array, a singly linked list and a stack. In addition, you’ll use these data structures in a method that implements a search in a “dark room”. Also, along the way you will get more experience with implementing Java interfaces, writing JUnit test cases, and using the Adapter design pattern.
