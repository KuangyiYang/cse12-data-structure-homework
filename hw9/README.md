## Project9 Binary Search Tree in C
### Summary
You will be implementing a Binary Search Tree in C. You have been provided with started code in BinaryTree.c. Input/output for this assignment will be handled through the command line. The values inserted into your BST will be strings of max length 100. Your BST must implement the following functionalities:
- insert
- find
- print node values in order
To do this you will implement the following functions:
- int compare()
- void insert()
- void find()
- void traverse()

### Run Instruction
- BE ON IENG6!There is wide variety of C compilers that produce different results. Develop on ieng6 either through SSH or in the labs.
- Navigate to the directory containing BinaryTree.c
- type gcc BinaryTree.c into the commandline. This is will produce a file
called a.out IF YOU HAVE NO COMPILE ERRORS. This is your executable.
- type ./a.out into the command line to run your executable.
